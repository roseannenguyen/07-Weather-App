Purpose: The objective of this assigment was to create a Weather Dashboard using Open Weather Map API. This allows the user to retrieve weather data from any city searched. This combined calling multiple APIs, using jQuery, Javascript, HTMl, and CSS. 

Challenges: I was not able to set up the search history and connect the local storage.
